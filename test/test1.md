A regular sentence
> hopefully a blockquote
> hopefully another blockquote line
Another regular sentence

Nope, the above did not work. How about this:
>blockquote 1
>
>blockquote 2

Need 2 lines (i.e. 1 full blank line) between end of blockquote and next regular sentence
Next sentence wtihout blank line
