Nothing to see here. My test repository for using GitHub, plus other bits and pieces that don't fit in anywhere else.

More info: I'll add more info here as needed.

## Reminder to self when creating new releases
First, create new branch if have not done so already (typically the dev branch, which I always prefer to delete after merging)

Next, in that dev branch, go to upload new files - these files should have the same name as the old files. This is better than deleting and then uploading, because a straight upload allows diff to be able to compare them. Upload the changed files into that new branch AND make sure that there is a short but meaningful description of changes for each file in the GitHub field
